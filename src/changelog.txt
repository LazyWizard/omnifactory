 Version 1.9b (January 5, 2015)
================================
(this version is not save compatible with earlier versions)
Compatibility fix for new economy/market systems
Fixed bug where wrong numbers were shown for analysis phase duration
Balance tweaks:
 - You must pay to add ships/weapons to the Omnifactory
 - The price of produced ships/weapons is vastly inflated

 Version 1.9 (May 9, 2014)
===========================
Many changes to the mod's code, but it should be backwards-compatible with 1.8b
New methods in OmniFac:
 - New constructor: OmniFac(SectorEntityToken station, String settingsFile)
 - OmniFacSettings getSettings()
 - String getSettingsFile()
 - setSettingsFile(String settingsFile)
New class OmniFacSettings:
 - boolean shouldShowAddedCargo()
 - boolean shouldShowAnalysisComplete()
 - boolean shouldShowLimitReached()
 - boolean shouldRemoveBrokenGoods()
 - float getShipAnalysisTimeMod()
 - float getWeaponAnalysisTimeMod()
 - float getShipProductionTimeMod()
 - float getWeaponProductionTimeMod()
 - int getRequiredCrew()
 - float getRequiredSuppliesPerDay()
 - float getRequiredFuelPerDay()
 - int getMaxHullsPerFighter()
 - int getMaxHullsPerFrigate()
 - int getMaxHullsPerDestroyer()
 - int getMaxHullsPerCruiser()
 - int getMaxHullsPerCapital()
 - float getMaxStacksPerWeapon()
Settings are reloaded from JSON every session instead of stored in the savefile
 (this also means individual settings cannot be changed through code anymore,
 and must be set as a whole using setSettingsFile() and another settings JSON)
Removed all other settings-related methods in OmniFac, with the exception of
 adding/removing restricted ships and weapons
The Omnifactory now removes weapons from ships before it consumes them
Fixed the Omnifactory and fighter wing names being displayed incorrectly
